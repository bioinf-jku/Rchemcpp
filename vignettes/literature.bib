  abstract =	 {Many chemoinformatics applications, including
                  high-throughput virtual screening, benefit from
                  being able to rapidly predict the physical,
                  chemical, and biological properties of small
                  molecules to screen large repositories and identify
                  suitable candidates. When training sets are
                  available, machine learning methods provide an
                  effective alternative to ab initio methods for these
                  predictions. Here, we leverage rich molecular
                  representations including 1D SMILES strings, 2D
                  graphs of bonds, and 3D coordinates to derive
                  efficient machine learning kernels to address
                  regression problems. We further expand the library
                  of available spectral kernels for small molecules
                  developed for classification problems to include
                  2.5D surface and 3D kernels using Delaunay
                  tetrahedrization and other techniques from
                  computational geometry, 3D pharmacophore kernels,
                  and 3.5D or 4D kernels capable of taking into
                  account multiple molecular configurations, such as
                  conformers. The kernels are comprehensively tested
                  using cross-validation and redundancy-reduction
                  methods on regression problems using several
                  available data sets to predict boiling points,
                  melting points, aqueous solubility, octanol/water
                  partition coefficients, and biological activity with
                  state-of-the art results. When sufficient training
                  data are available, 2D spectral kernels in general
                  tend to yield the best and most robust results,
                  better than state-of-the art. On data sets
                  containing thousands of molecules, the kernels
                  achieve a squared correlation coefficient of 0.91
                  for aqueous solubility prediction and 0.94 for
                  octanol/water partition coefficient prediction.
                  Averaging over conformations improves the
                  performance of kernels based on the
                  three-dimensional structure of molecules, especially
                  on challenging data sets. Kernel predictors for
                  aqueous solubility (kSOL), LogP (kLOGP), and melting
                  point (kMELT) are available over the Web through:

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we report on the potential of a
                  recently developed neural network for structures
                  applied to the prediction of physical chemical
                  properties of compounds. The proposed recursive
                  neural network (RecNN) model is able to directly
                  take as input a structured representation of the
                  molecule and to model a direct and adaptive
                  relationship between the molecular structure and
                  target property. Therefore, it combines in a
                  learning system the flexibility and general
                  advantages of a neural network model with the
                  representational power of a structured domain. As a
                  result, a completely new approach to quantitative
                  structure-activity relationship/quantitative
                  structure-property relationship (QSPR/QSAR) analysis
                  is obtained. An original representation of the
                  molecular structures has been developed accounting
                  for both the occurrence of specific atoms/groups and
                  the topological relationships among them. Gibbs free
                  energy of solvation in water, Delta(solv)G degrees ,
                  has been chosen as a benchmark for the model. The
                  different approaches proposed in the literature for
                  the prediction of this property have been
                  reconsidered from a general perspective. The
                  advantages of RecNN as a suitable tool for the
                  automatization of fundamental parts of the QSPR/QSAR
                  analysis have been highlighted. The RecNN model has
                  been applied to the analysis of the Delta(solv)G
                  degrees in water of 138 monofunctional acyclic
                  organic compounds and tested on an external data set
                  of 33 compounds. As a result of the statistical
                  analysis, we obtained, for the predictive accuracy
                  estimated on the test set, correlation coefficient R
                  = 0.9985, standard deviation S = 0.68 kJ mol(-1),
                  and mean absolute error MAE = 0.46 kJ mol(-1).  The
                  inherent ability of RecNN to abstract chemical
                  knowledge through the adaptive learning process has
                  been investigated by principal components analysis
                  of the internal representations computed by the
                  network. It has been found that the model recognizes
                  the chemical compounds on the basis of a nontrivial
                  combination of their chemical structure and target
                  property.},

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Several kernel-based methods have been
                  recently introduced for the classification of small
                  molecules. Most available kernels on molecules are
                  based on 2D representations obtained from chemical
                  structures, but far less work has focused so far on
                  the definition of effective kernels that can also
                  exploit 3D information. RESULTS: We introduce new
                  ideas for building kernels on small molecules that
                  can effectively use and combine 2D and 3D
                  information. We tested these kernels in conjunction
                  with support vector machines for binary
                  classification on the 60 NCI cancer screening
                  datasets as well as on the NCI HIV data set. Our
                  results show that 3D information leveraged by these
                  kernels can consistently improve prediction accuracy
                  in all datasets. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of
                  the small molecule classifier is available from

  abstract =	 {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in
                  which myelin is progressively degraded. Because
                  degraded myelin may both initiate and accelerate
                  disease progression, clearing degraded myelin from
                  extracellular spaces may be critical. In this study,
                  we prepared myelin vesicles (MV) from rat brains as
                  a model of degraded myelin.  Murine embryonic
                  fibroblasts (MEFs) rapidly internalized MVs, which
                  accumulated in lysosomes only when these cells
                  expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
                  protein (LRP1). Receptor-associated protein (RAP),
                  which binds LRP1 and inhibits interaction with other
                  ligands, blocked MV uptake by LRP1-expressing
                  MEFs. As a complementary approach, we prepared
                  primary cultures of rat astrocytes, microglia and
                  oligodendrocytes. All three cell types expressed
                  LRP1 and mediated MV uptake, which was inhibited by
                  RAP. LRP1 gene-silencing in oligodendrocytes also
                  blocked MV uptake. Myelin basic protein (MBP), which
                  was expressed as a recombinant protein, bound
                  directly to LRP1. MBP-specific antibody inhibited MV
                  uptake by oligodendrocytes. In experimental
                  autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, LRP1 protein
                  expression was substantially increased in the
                  cerebellum and spinal cord. LRP1 colocalized with
                  multiple CNS cell types. These studies establish
                  LRP1 as a major receptor for phagocytosis of
                  degraded myelin, which may function alone or in
                  concert with co-receptors previously implicated in
                  myelin phagocytosis.},

  abstract =	 {Cellular functions result from intricate networks of
                  molecular interactions, which involve not only
                  proteins and nucleic acids but also small chemical
                  compounds. Here we present an efficient algorithm
                  for comparing two chemical structures of compounds,
                  where the chemical structure is treated as a graph
                  consisting of atoms as nodes and covalent bonds as
                  edges. On the basis of the concept of functional
                  groups, 68 atom types (node types) are defined for
                  carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other atomic species
                  with different environments, which has enabled
                  detection of biochemically meaningful
                  features. Maximal common subgraphs of two graphs can
                  be found by searching for maximal cliques in the
                  association graph, and we have introduced heuristics
                  to accelerate the clique finding and to detect
                  optimal local matches (simply connected common
                  subgraphs). Our procedure was applied to the
                  comparison and clustering of 9383 compounds, mostly
                  metabolic compounds, in the KEGG/LIGAND
                  database. The largest clusters of similar compounds
                  were related to carbohydrates, and the clusters
                  corresponded well to the categorization of pathways
                  as represented by the KEGG pathway map numbers. When
                  each pathway map was examined in more detail, finer
                  clusters could be identified corresponding to

                  level data}},
  journal =	 {Bioinformatics},
  year =	 2006,

  abstract =	 {Motivation: We propose a new model-based technique
                  for summarizing high-density oligonucleotide array
                  data at probe level for Affymetrix GeneChips. The
                  new summarization method is based on a factor
                  analysis model for which a Bayesian maximum a
                  posteriori method optimizes the model parameters
                  under the assumption of Gaussian measurement
                  noise. Thereafter, the RNA concentration is
                  estimated from the model.  In contrast to previous
                  methods our new method called Factor Analysis
                  for Robust Microarray Summarization (FARMS)
                  supplies both P-values indicating interesting
                  information and signal intensity values.Results: We
                  compare FARMS on Affymetrix's spike-in and Gene
                  Logic's dilution data to established algorithms like
                  Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0, Model Based
                  Expression Index (MBEI), Robust Multi-array Average
                  (RMA). Further, we compared FARMS with 43 other
                  methods via the Affycomp II competition. The
                  experimental results show that FARMS with default
                  parameters outperforms previous methods if both
                  sensitivity and specificity are simultaneously
                  considered by the area under the receiver operating
                  curve (AUC). We measured two quantities through the
                  AUC: correctly detected expression changes versus
                  wrongly detected (fold change) and correctly
                  detected significantly different expressed genes in
                  two sets of arrays versus wrongly detected
                  (P-value). Furthermore FARMS is computationally less
                  expensive then RMA, MAS and MBEI.Availability: The

                  to explore possible interactions
                  computationally. Here we compared 3,665 US Food and
                  Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and
                  investigational drugs against hundreds of targets,
                  defining each target by its ligands.  Chemical
                  similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted
                  thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were
                  tested experimentally, including the antagonism of
                  the beta(1) receptor by the transporter inhibitor
                  Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine
                  (5-HT) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex,
                  and antagonism of the histamine H(4) receptor by the
                  enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new
                  drug-target associations were confirmed, five of
                  which were potent (<100 nM). The physiological
                  relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine
                  (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a
                  knockout mouse.  The chemical similarity approach is
                  systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest

	information and prior knowledge about the data and problems to be
	handled. In particular, with kernel methods molecules do not need
	to be represented and stored explicitly as vectors or fingerprints,
	but only to be compared to each other through a comparison function
	technically called a kernel. While classical kernels can be used
	to compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules, completely
	new kernels were developed in the recent years to directly compare
	the 2D or 3D structures of molecules, without the need for an explicit
	vectorization step through the extraction of molecular descriptors.
	While still in their infancy, these approaches have already demonstrated
	their relevance on several toxicity prediction and structure-activity
	relationship problems.},

                  chosen for the combinatorial library or in the

                  report shows that for IC(50) values determined as a
                  follow-up to 115 high-throughput screening assays,
                  there is only a 30\% chance that a compound that is

                  for the assessment of the potential of chemicals and
                  drugs to elicit genetic damage in mammalian cells in
                  vitro. Due to the limitations of experimental
                  genotoxicity testing in early drug discovery phases,
                  a model to predict the chromosome aberration test
                  yielding high accuracy and providing guidance for
                  structure optimization is urgently needed. In this
                  paper, we describe a machine learning approach for
                  predicting the outcome of this assay based on the
                  structure of the investigated compound.  The novelty
                  of the proposed method consists in combining a
                  maximum common subgraph kernel for measuring the
                  similarity of two chemical graphs with the potential
                  support vector machine for classification.  In
                  contrast to standard support vector machine
                  classifiers, the proposed approach does not provide
                  a black box model but rather allows to visualize
                  structural elements with high positive or negative
                  contribution to the class decision. In order to

                  protocol, which we make publicly available. In a

                  pharmaceutical industry as well as to other graph

	in the literature reaching accuracies of 91.5\% on the Mutag dataset,
	65-67\% on the PTC (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) dataset, and

                  important role in the early drug discovery
                  stage. The outcomes of high-throughput screenings
                  are a valuable source for machine learning
                  algorithms to infer such models. Besides a strong
                  performance, the interpretability of a machine
                  learning model is a desired property to guide the
                  optimization of a compound in later drug discovery
                  stages. Linear support vector machines showed to
                  have a convincing performance on large-scale data
                  sets. The goal of this study is to present a heat
                  map molecule coloring technique to interpret linear
                  support vector machine models. Based on the weights
                  of a linear model, the visualization approach colors
                  each atom and bond of a compound according to its
                  importance for activity.We evaluated our approach on
                  a toxicity data set, a chromosome aberration data
                  set, and the maximum unbiased validation data sets.
                  The experiments show that our method sensibly
                  visualizes structure-property and structure-activity
                  relationships of a linear support vector machine
                  model. The coloring of ligands in the binding pocket
                  of several crystal structures of a maximum unbiased
                  validation data set target indicates that our
                  approach assists to determine the correct ligand
                  orientation in the binding pocket. Additionally, the
                  heat map coloring enables the identification of
                  substructures important for the binding of an
                  inhibitor.In combination with heat map coloring,
                  linear support vector machine models can help to
                  guide the modification of a compound in later stages
                  of drug discovery. Particularly substructures
                  identified as important by our method might be a
                  starting point for optimization of a lead
                  compound. The heat map coloring should be considered
                  as complementary to structure based modeling
                  approaches. As such, it helps to get a better
                  understanding of the binding mode of an inhibitor.},

                  structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. The
                  present paper shows that traditionally used
                  validation parameters (leave-one-out Q(2) for
                  internal validation and predictive R(2) for external
                  validation) may be supplemented with two novel
                  parameters r(m)(2) and R(p)(2) for a stricter test
                  of validation. The parameter r(m)(2)((overall))
                  penalizes a model for large differences between
                  observed and predicted values of the compounds of
                  the whole set (considering both training and test
                  sets) while the parameter R(p)(2) penalizes model
                  R(2) for large differences between determination
                  coefficient of nonrandom model and square of mean
                  correlation coefficient of random models in case of
                  a randomization test. Two other variants of r(m)(2)
                  parameter, r(m)(2)((LOO)) and r(m)(2)((test)),
                  penalize a model more strictly than Q(2) and
                  R(2)(pred) respectively. Three different data sets
                  of moderate to large size have been used to develop
                  multiple models in order to indicate the suitability
                  of the novel parameters in QSAR studies. The results
                  show that in many cases the developed models could
                  satisfy the requirements of conventional parameters
                  (Q(2) and R(2)(pred)) but fail to achieve the
                  required values for the novel parameters r(m)(2) and
                  R(p)(2).  Moreover, these parameters also help in
                  identifying the best models from among a set of
                  comparable models. Thus, a test for these two
                  parameters is suggested to be a more stringent
                  requirement than the traditional validation
                  parameters to decide acceptability of a predictive
                  QSAR model, especially when a regulatory decision is

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: Small molecules play a fundamental role
                  in organic chemistry and biology. They can be used
                  to probe biological systems and to discover new
                  drugs and other useful compounds. As increasing
                  numbers of large datasets of small molecules become
                  available, it is necessary to develop computational
                  methods that can deal with molecules of variable
                  size and structure and predict their physical,
                  chemical and biological properties. RESULTS: Here we
                  develop several new classes of kernels for small
                  molecules using their 1D, 2D and 3D representations.
                  In 1D, we consider string kernels based on SMILES
                  strings. In 2D, we introduce several similarity
                  kernels based on conventional or generalized
                  fingerprints. Generalized fingerprints are derived
                  by counting in different ways subpaths contained in
                  the graph of bonds, using depth-first searches. In
                  3D, we consider similarity measures between
                  histograms of pairwise distances between atom
                  classes. These kernels can be computed efficiently
                  and are applied to problems of classification and
                  prediction of mutagenicity, toxicity and anti-cancer
                  activity on three publicly available datasets. The
                  results derived using cross-validation methods are
                  state-of-the-art. Tradeoffs between various kernels
                  are briefly discussed. AVAILABILITY: Datasets

  title =	 {A new pairwise kernel for biological network
                  inference with support vector machines.},
  journal =	 {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year =	 2007,
  volume =	 {8 Suppl 10},
  pages =	 {S8},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Much recent work in bioinformatics has
                  focused on the inference of various types of
                  biological networks, representing gene regulation,
                  metabolic processes, protein-protein interactions,
                  etc.  A common setting involves inferring network
                  edges in a supervised fashion from a set of
                  high-confidence edges, possibly characterized by
                  multiple, heterogeneous data sets (protein sequence,
                  gene expression, etc.). RESULTS: Here, we
                  distinguish between two modes of inference in this
                  setting: direct inference based upon similarities
                  between nodes joined by an edge, and indirect
                  inference based upon similarities between one pair
                  of nodes and another pair of nodes. We propose a
                  supervised approach for the direct case by
                  translating it into a distance metric learning
                  problem. A relaxation of the resulting convex
                  optimization problem leads to the support vector
                  machine (SVM) algorithm with a particular kernel for
                  pairs, which we call the metric learning pairwise
                  kernel. This new kernel for pairs can easily be used
                  by most SVM implementations to solve problems of
                  supervised classification and inference of pairwise
                  relationships from heterogeneous data.  We
                  demonstrate, using several real biological networks
                  and genomic datasets, that this approach often
                  improves upon the state-of-the-art SVM for indirect
                  inference with another pairwise kernel, and that the
                  combination of both kernels always improves upon
                  each individual kernel. CONCLUSION: The metric
                  learning pairwise kernel is a new formulation to
                  infer pairwise relationships with SVM, which
                  provides state-of-the-art results for the inference
                  of several biological networks from heterogeneous
                  genomic data.},

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btv373}, 
abstract ={Summary: We have developed Rchempp, a web service that identifies structurally similar compounds (structural analogs) in large-scale molecule databases. The service allows compounds to be queried in the widely used ChEMBL, DrugBank and the Connectivity Map databases. Rchemcpp utilizes the best performing similarity functions, i.e. molecule kernels, as measures for structural similarity. Molecule kernels have proven superior performance over other similarity measures and are currently excelling at machine learning challenges. In order to considerably reduce computational time, and thereby make it feasible as a web service, a novel efficient prefiltering strategy has been developed, which maintains the sensitivity of the method. By exploiting information contained in public databases, the web service facilitates many applications crucial for the drug development process, such as prioritizing compounds after screening or reducing adverse side-effects during late phases. Rchemc
pp was used in the DeepTox pipeline that has won the Tox21 Data Challenge and is frequently used by researchers in pharmaceutical companies.Availability: The web service and the R package are freely available via http://shiny.bioinf.jku.at/Analoging/ and via Bioconductor.},
